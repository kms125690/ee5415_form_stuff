In Android, a widget is a View object that serves as an interface for interaction with the user.
Android provides a set of fully implemented widgets, like buttons, checkboxes, and text-entry
fields, so you can quickly build your UI. Some widgets provided by Android are more complex,
like a date picker, a clock, and zoom controls. But you are not limited to the kinds of widgets
provided by the Android platform. If you would like to do something more customized and create
your own actionable elements, you can, by defining your own View object or by extending and
combining existing widgets.
